        <h2>Getting to know KPOP</h2>
        <p><strong>K-pop</strong> idol music, meanwhile, took hold in the United States during the exact same era, and it was the
            opposite: a maximalist dreamland full of <em>color, high concept-performances and videos</em>, a plethora of
            performers and unrivaled choreography. If Top 40 in America wanted solo singers so soft every breath was
            caught on mic over a mid-tempo chorus, K-pop appeared to offer a genre-less alternative: constant
            stimulation, euphoria delivered in eight to 10 melodies and fantastical harmonies in a single track. (That
            is, K-pop idol music— in the West, "K-pop" is frequently used synonymously with Korean idol music, pop with
            a high-production value and produced in a deliberate studio system, as it is in this piece.)</p>

        </ol>

        <h2>Key elements that make KPOP unique</h2>
        <p>K-pop is unique because it blends diverse musical styles—such as pop, hip-hop, EDM, and R&B—into a polished,
